# Objectives

The objective of this study is to leverage network analysis and digital epidemiology techniques to detect echo chambers in the Colab.re app. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Construct a social network graph of user interactions within the Colab.re app using the edgelist data.
2. Apply spectral clustering and community detection algorithms to identify clusters of users with similar interaction patterns.
3. Use the SIR and SEIR models from digital epidemiology to simulate the spread of opinions or beliefs within the identified user clusters.
4. Develop a real-time dashboard to monitor the emergence and growth of echo chambers within the Colab.re app based on the results from the network analysis and digital epidemiology models.

By achieving these objectives, we hope to provide insights into the formation and proliferation of echo chambers within the Colab.re app and contribute to the development of effective strategies for combating the negative impacts of echo chambers in online communities.
