description: >
  This image displays a network map using the Yifan-Hu layout, providing a visual representation of the interconnectedness and clustering within the network. In this visualization, all nodes are uniform in size, emphasizing the size of the network as a whole rather than highlighting individual nodes. The Yifan-Hu algorithm has organized the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and maximizes the spacing between nodes, resulting in a clear and comprehensible layout. This visualization allows viewers to gain an overview of the network's structure, identify clusters or communities within the network, and understand the overall scale and complexity of the interconnected relationships.
