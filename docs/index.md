This is a companion website to a research paper produced as a dissertation for the Masters Degree in Software Engineering program at [Cesar School](http://cesar.school).

The paper tries to respond the research question:
> Is it possible to identify echo chambers in a social network using social network analysis?

The study uses a dataset with an edgelist from the Brazillian app [Colab.re](http://colab.re),  a social network app that allows citizens to report problems in their communities, such as issues with public transportation, waste management, and infrastructure. The platform aims to increase transparency and accountability in government by enabling citizens to share information and feedback directly with public officials. Users can also vote and comment on other people's reports, which helps prioritize the most pressing issues. Colab.re has gained popularity in Brazil and has been adopted by several municipalities as a tool for citizen engagement and participation in local governance.

To answer this question, the paper takes a [Social Network Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis) approach, exploring the network dataset with [Gephi](https://gephi.org), isolating clusters and aplying the common SNA layouts and algorithms.

Check out the gallery for the generated Gephi Graphs.
